## My process

I started building this from the mobile breakpoint first, then simply adjusted
the card max-width on larger screens via a tablet and up breakpoint.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I enjoyed this blog preview card as it's something that I often need to create
for client projects. This implementation was pure html & css with no
interactivity to speak of.

### Useful resources

- [fit-content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/fit-content) -
  Had to look up this css property.
