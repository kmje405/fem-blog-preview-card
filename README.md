## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I enjoyed this blog preview card as it's something that I often need to create
for client projects. This implementation was pure html & css with no
interactivity to speak of.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/fit-content) -
  Had to look up this css property.
